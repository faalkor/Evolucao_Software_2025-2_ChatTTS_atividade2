Localization:
- Long Method: The `download_models` method contains a long method that handles different sources for downloading models.
- Magic Numbers: The `source` parameter has a default value of "local", which is a magic number indicating the default source for downloading models.
- Cognitive Complexity: The `download_models` method has a high cognitive complexity due to its multiple conditional branches and error handling.

Evidence:
- Long Method: The `download_models` method contains multiple conditional branches and error handling, making it a long method.
- Magic Numbers: The default value of the `source` parameter is "local", which is a magic number.
- Cognitive Complexity: The `download_models` method has a high cognitive complexity due to its multiple conditional branches and error handling.
